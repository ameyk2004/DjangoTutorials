## Introduction

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It follows the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle, making it easier to build and maintain complex, database-driven websites. Django handles much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. With built-in features like an admin interface, ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), authentication, and more, Django is a powerful tool for both beginners and experienced developers.


### Key Features of Django:

- **Scalability**: Django is used by some of the busiest sites, demonstrating its ability to scale.
Security: Django helps developers avoid common security mistakes, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and cross-site request forgery.
- **Versatility**: Whether you're building a content management system, a social network, or a scientific computing platform, Django is up to the task.
- **Community**: With a vibrant community, extensive documentation, and a wide array of third-party packages, Django is well-supported.
